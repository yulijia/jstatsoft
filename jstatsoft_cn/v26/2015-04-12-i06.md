| 摘要 | Manufacturers and government agencies frequently use acceptance sampling to decide whether a lot from a supplier or exporting country should be accepted or rejected.  International standards on acceptance sampling provide sampling plans for specific circumstances.| |
 The aim of this package is to provide an easy-to-use interface to visualize single, double or multiple sampling plans.  In addition, methods have been provided to enable the user to assess sampling plans against pre-specified levels of performance, as measured by the probability of acceptance for a given level of quality in the lot.| |
