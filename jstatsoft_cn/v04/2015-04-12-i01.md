| 摘要 | Rweb is a freely accessible statistical analysis environment that is delivered through the World Wide Web (WWW). It is based on R, a well known statistical analysis package. The only requirement to run the basic Rweb interface is a WWW browser that supports forms. If you want graphical output you must, of course, have a browser that supports graphics. The interface provides access to WWW accessible data sets, so you may run Rweb on your own data. Rweb can provide a four window statistical computing environment (code input, text output, graphical output, and error information) through browsers that support Javascript. There is also a set of point and click modules under development for use in introductory statistics courses. | |
