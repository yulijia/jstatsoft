| 摘要 | This article describes the R package FrF2 for design and analysis of experiments with 2-level factors. The package offers both regular and non-regular fractional factorial 2-level designs, in the regular case with blocking and split plot facilities and algorithms for ensuring estimability of certain two-factor interactions. Furthermore, simple analysis facilities are on offer, first and foremost plotting functions for half normal plots, main effects and interaction plots, and cube plots. Package FrF2 receives infrastructure support from package DoE.base and heavily builds on a subgraph isomorphism algorithm from package igraph for one of its estimability algorithms.| |
