| 摘要 | A software package for fitting and assessing multidimensional point process models using the R statistical computing environment is described. Methods of residual analysis based on random thinning are discussed and implemented. Features of the software are demonstrated using data on wildfire occurrences in Los Angeles County, California and earthquake occurrences in Northern California.| |
