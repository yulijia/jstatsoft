| 摘要 | Statistical process control (SPC) descibes a widely-used set of approaches used to detect shifts in processes in, for example, manufacturing.  Among these are "control charts".  Control charts and other SPC techniques have been in use since at least the 1950s, and, because they are comparatively unsophisticated, are often used by management or operations personnel without formal statistical training. These personnel will often have experience with the popular spreadsheet program <b>Excel</b>, but may have less training on a mainstream statistical package. Base <b>Excel</b> does not provide the ability to draw control charts directly, although add-ins for that purpose are available for purchase.| |
 We present a free add-in for <b>Excel</b> that draws the most common sorts of control charts. It follows the development of the textbook of Montgomery (2005), so it may be well-suited for instructional purposes.| |
