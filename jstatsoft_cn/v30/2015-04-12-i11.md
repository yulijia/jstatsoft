| 摘要 | Designs for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (ER-fMRI) that help to efficiently achieve the statistical goals while taking into account the psychological constraints and customized requirements are in great demand. This is not only because of the popularity of ER-fMRI but also because of the high cost of ER-fMRI experiments; being able to collect highly informative data is crucial. In this paper, we develop a <code>MATLAB</code> program which can accommodate many user-specified experimental conditions to efficiently find ER-fMRI optimal designs.| |
