| 摘要 | Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are growing in popularity as a complement or alternative to the traditional command line interfaces to R. <b>RGtk2</b> is an R package for creating GUIs in R. The package provides programmatic access to <b>GTK</b>+ 2.0, an open-source GUI toolkit written in C. To construct a GUI, the R programmer calls <b>RGtk2</b> functions that map to functions in the underlying <b>GTK</b>+ library. This paper introduces the basic concepts underlying <b>GTK</b>+ and explains how to use <b>RGtk2</b> to construct GUIs from R. The tutorial is based on simple and pratical programming examples. We also provide more complex examples illustrating the advanced features of the package. The design of the <b>RGtk2</b> API and the low-level interface from R to <b>GTK</b>+ are discussed at length. We compare <b>RGtk2</b> to alternative GUI toolkits for R.| |
