| 摘要 | Today, many experiments in the field of behavioral sciences are conducted using a computer. While there is a broad choice of computer programs facilitating the process of conducting experiments as well as programs for statistical analysis there are relatively few programs facilitating the intermediate step of data aggregation. ART has been developed in order to fill this gap and to provide a computer program for data aggregation that has a graphical user interface such that aggregation can be done more easily and without any programming. All “rules” that are necessary to extract variables can be seen “at a glance” which helps the user to conduct even complex aggregations with several hundreds of variables and makes aggregation more resistant against errors. ART runs with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8 and it is free. Copies (executable and source code) are available at http://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/art.html.| |
