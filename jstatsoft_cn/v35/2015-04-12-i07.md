| 摘要 | This paper describes <b>Mateda-2.0</b>, a <b>MATLAB</b> package for estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This  package can be used to solve  single and multi-objective discrete and continuous optimization problems using EDAs based on undirected and directed probabilistic graphical models. The implementation contains several methods commonly employed by EDAs.  It is also conceived as an open package to allow users to incorporate different combinations of selection, learning, sampling, and local search procedures. Additionally, it includes methods  to extract, process and visualize the structures learned by the probabilistic models. This way, it can unveil previously unknown information about the optimization problem domain. <b>Mateda-2.0</b> also incorporates a module for creating and validating function models based on the probabilistic models learned by EDAs.| |
