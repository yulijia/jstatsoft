| 摘要 | Statistical techniques play a major role in contemporary methods for analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. In addition to the central role that classical statistical methods play in research using MRI, statistical modeling and machine learning techniques are key to many modern data analysis pipelines. Applications for these techniques cover a broad spectrum of research, including many preclinical and clinical studies, and in some cases these methods are working their way into widespread routine use.
