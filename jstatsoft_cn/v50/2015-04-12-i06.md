| 摘要 | <b>dlmap</b> is a software package capable of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a variety of genetic studies. Unlike most other QTL mapping packages, <b>dlmap</b> is built on a linear mixed model platform, and thus can simultaneously handle multiple sources of genetic and environmental variation. Furthermore, it can accommodate both experimental crosses and association mapping populations within a versatile modeling framework. The software implements a mapping algorithm with separate detection and localization stages in a user-friendly manner. It accepts data in various common formats, has a flexible modeling environment, and summarizes results both graphically and numerically.</b></b>| |
