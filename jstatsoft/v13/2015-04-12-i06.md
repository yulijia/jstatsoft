| Abstract | We present a general framework of exploratory data analysis defining a set of concepts and prototypes developed within the Lisp-Stat programming environment for a M-to-M links multidimensional approach. We overview the main domains and fundamentals on which we lay the developed interactive GIS. In a second stage, we detail the different prototypes we implemented in a software called ARPEGE' and how they collaborate in providing an interactive spatial data exploration. Then we show four examples of concrete geographical applications and their underlaying data models. We end on a discussion about the contribution and the limitations of our conceptual framework and its associated software, and open to future research.| |
