| Abstract | This paper offers a visual tour throughout ViSta 6.4, a freeware statistical program based on Lisp-Stat and focused on techniques for statistical visualization (Young 2004). This travel around ViSta is based on screen recordings that illustrate the main features of the program in action. The following aspects of ViSta 6.4 are displayed: the program's interface (ViSta's desktop, menubar and pop-up menus, help system); its data management capabilities (data input and editing, data transformations); features associated to data analysis (data description, statistical modeling); and the options for Lisp-Stat development in ViSta. The video recordings associated to this tour (.wmv files) can be visualized at http://www.jstatsoft.org/v13/i08/ using the Internet Explorer navigator, or by clicking on the figures in the paper.| |
