| Abstract | We present a non exhaustive bibliographical and comparative study of the problem of simulation and identification of the fractional Brownian motion. The discussed implementation is realized within the software S-plus 3.4. A few simulations illustrate this work. Furthermore, we propose a test based on the asymptotic behavior of a self-similarity parameter's estimator to explore the quality of different generators. This procedure, easily computable, allows us to extract an efficient method of simulation. In the Appendix are described the S-plus scripts related to simulation and identification methods of the fBm.
