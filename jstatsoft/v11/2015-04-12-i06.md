| Abstract | The mimR package for graphical modelling in R is introduced. We present some facilities of mimR, namely those relating specifying models, editing models, fitting models and doing model search. We also discuss the entities needed for flexible graphical modelling in terms of an ob ject structure. An example about a latent variable model is presented.| |
