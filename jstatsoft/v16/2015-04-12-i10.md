| Abstract | Item Tree Analysis (ITA) is an explorative method of data analysis which can be used to establish a hierarchical structure on a set of dichotomous items from a questionnaire or test. There are currently two different algorithms available to perform an ITA. We describe a computer program called ITA 2.0 which implements both of these algorithms.  In addition we show with a concrete data set how the program can be used for the analysis of questionnaire data.| |
