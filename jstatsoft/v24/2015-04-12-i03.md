| Abstract | We describe some of the capabilities of the ergm package and the statistical theory underlying it.  This package contains tools for accomplishing three important, and inter-related, tasks involving exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs):  estimation, simulation, and goodness of fit.  More precisely, ergm has the capability of approximating a maximum likelihood estimator for an ERGM given a network data set; simulating new network data sets from a fitted ERGM using Markov chain Monte Carlo; and assessing how well a fitted ERGM does at capturing characteristics of a particular network data set.| |
