| Abstract | Modern social network analysis---the analysis of relational data arising from social systems---is a computationally intensive area of research.  Here, we provide an overview of a software package which provides support for a range of network analytic functionality within the R statistical computing environment.  General categories of currently supported functionality are described, and brief examples of package syntax and usage are shown.| |
