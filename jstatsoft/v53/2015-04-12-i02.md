| Abstract | <b>stpp</b> is an R package for analyzing, simulating and displaying space-time point patterns. It covers many of the models encountered in applications of point process methods to the study of spatio-temporal phenomena. The package also includes estimators of the space-time inhomogeneous K-function and pair correlation function. <b>stpp</b> is the first dedicated unified computational environment in the area of spatio-temporal point processes. In this paper we describe space-time point processes and introduce the package <b>stpp</b> to new users.| |
