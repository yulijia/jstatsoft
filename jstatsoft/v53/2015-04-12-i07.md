| Abstract | The R package <b>extracat</b> provides two new graphical methods for displaying categorical data extending the concepts of multiple barcharts and parallel coordinates plots. The first method called <code>rmb</code> plot uses a crossover of mosaicplots and multiple barcharts to display the frequencies of a data table split up into conditional relative frequencies of one target variable and the absolute frequencies of the corresponding combinations of the remaining explanatory variables. It provides a well-structured representation of the data which is easy to interpret and allows precise comparisons. The graphic can additionally be used as a generalization of spineplots or with barcharts for the conditional relative frequencies. Several options, including ceiling censored zooming, residual shadings and a choice of color palettes, are provided. An interactive version based on the R package <b>iWidgets</b> is also presented. The second graphic <code>cpcp</code> uses the interactive parallel coordinates plots in the <b>iplots</b> package to visualize categorical data. Sequences of points are used to represent each of the variable categories, while ordering algorithms are applied to represent a hierarchical structure in the data and keep the arrangement clear. This interactive graphic is well-suited for exploratory analysis and allows a visual interpretation even for a higher number of variables and a mixture of categorical and numeric scales.| |
