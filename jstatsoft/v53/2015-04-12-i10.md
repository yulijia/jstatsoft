| Abstract | Orthogonal fractional factorial designs (OFFDs) are frequently used in many fields of application, including medicine, engineering and agriculture. In this paper we present a software tool for the generation of minimum size OFFDs. The software, that has been implemented in SAS/IML, puts neither a restriction on the number of levels of each factor nor on the orthogonality constraints. The algorithm is based on the joint use of polynomial counting function and complex coding of levels and follows the approach presented in Fontana (2013).| |
