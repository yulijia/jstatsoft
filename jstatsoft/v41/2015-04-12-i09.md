| Abstract | This paper uses several examples to show how the econometrics program <b>RATS</b> can be used to analyze state space models. It demonstrates Kalman filtering and smoothing, estimation of hyperparameters, unconditional and conditional simulation. It also provides a more complicated example where a dynamic simultaneous equations model is transformed into a proper state space representation and its unknown parameters are estimated.| |
