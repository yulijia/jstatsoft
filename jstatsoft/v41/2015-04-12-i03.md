| Abstract | The use of state space models and their inference is illustrated using the package <b>SsfPack</b> for Ox. After a rather long introduction that explains the use of <b>SsfPack</b> and many of its functions, four case-studies illustrate the practical implementation of the software to real world problems through short sample programs.
