| Abstract | This paper reviews the use of <b>STAMP</b> (Structural Time Series Analyser, Modeler and Predictor) for modeling time series data using state-space methods with unobserved components. <b>STAMP</b> is a commercial, GUI-based program that runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers as part of the larger <b>OxMetrics</b> System. <b>STAMP</b> can estimate a wide-variety of both univariate and multivariate state-space models, provides a wide array of diagnostics, and has a batch mode capability. The use of <b>STAMP</b> is illustrated for the Nile river data which is analyzed throughout this issue, as well as by modeling a variety of oceanographic and climate related data sets. The analyses of the oceanographic and climate data illustrate the breadth of models available in <b>STAMP</b>, and that state-space methods produce results that provide new insights into important scientific problems.| |
