| Abstract | Recently, computational methods and software have been receiving more attention in the econometrics literature, emphasizing that they are integral components of modern econometric research.  This has also promoted the development of many new econometrics software packages written in <b>R</b> and made available on the Comprehensive <b>R</b> Archive Network. This special volume on "Econometrics in <b>R</b>" features a selection of these recent activities that includes packages for econometric analysis of cross-section, time series and panel data. This introduction to the special volume highlights the contents of the contributions and embeds them into a brief overview of other past, present, and future projects for econometrics in <b>R</b>.| |
