| Abstract | We present a set of functions in S-PLUS to implement the clustered data generalized additive marginal modelling (CDGAM) strategy proposed by Berhane and Tibshirani (1998). A variety of working correlation structures are supported, and the regression basis may include components from the family of smoothing splines.| |
