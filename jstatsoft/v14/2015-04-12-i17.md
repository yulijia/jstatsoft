| Abstract | The gRbase package is intended to set the framework for computer packages for data analysis using graphical models. The gRbase package is developed for the open source language, R, and is available for several platforms. The package is intended to be widely extendible and flexible so that package developers may implement further types of graphical models using the available methods.

 In this paper, we show how these building blocks can be combined and integrated with inference engines in the special cases of hierarchical loglinear models. We also illustrate how to extend the package to deal with other types of graphical models, in this case the graphical Gaussian models.| |
