| Abstract | A web interface, named WebBUGS, is developed to conduct Bayesian analysis online over the Internet through OpenBUGS and R. WebBUGS can be used with the minimum requirement of a web browser both remotely and locally. WebBUGS has many collaborative features such as email notification and sharing. WebBUGS also eases the use of OpenBUGS by providing built-in model templates, data management module, and other useful modules. In this paper, the use of WebBUGS is illustrated and discussed.
