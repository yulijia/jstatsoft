| Abstract | We introduce a pathwise algorithm for the Cox proportional hazards model, regularized by convex combinations of <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> penalties (elastic net). Our algorithm fits via cyclical coordinate descent, and employs warm starts to find a solution along a regularization path. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on real and simulated data sets, and find considerable speedup between our algorithm and competing methods.| |
