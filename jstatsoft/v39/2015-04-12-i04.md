| Abstract | This paper describes the <b>R</b> package <b>mhsmm</b> which implements estimation and prediction methods for hidden Markov and semi-Markov models for multiple observation sequences. Such techniques are of interest when observed data is thought to be dependent on some unobserved (or hidden) state. Hidden Markov models only allow a geometrically distributed sojourn time in a given state, while hidden semi-Markov models extend this by allowing an arbitrary sojourn distribution. We demonstrate the software with simulation examples and an application involving the modelling of the ovarian cycle of dairy cows.| |
