| Abstract | Object orientation provides a flexible framework for the implementation of the convolution of arbitrary distributions of real-valued random variables. We discuss an algorithm which is based on the fast Fourier transform. It directly applies to lattice-supported distributions. In the case of continuous distributions an additional discretization to a linear lattice is necessary and the resulting lattice-supported distributions are suitably smoothed after convolution.
