| Abstract | We present an R package for the simulation of simple and complex survival data. It covers different situations, including recurrent events and multiple events. The main simulation routine allows the user to introduce an arbitrary number of distributions, each corresponding to a new event or episode, with its parameters, choosing between the Weibull (and exponential as a particular case), log-logistic and log-normal distributions.| |
