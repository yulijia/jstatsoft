| Abstract | We describe an R package for determining the optimal price of an asset which is “perishable” in a certain sense, given the intensity of customer arrivals and a time-varying price sensitivity function which speciﬁes the probability that a customer will purchase an asset oﬀered at a given price at a given time. The package deals with the case of customers arriving in groups, with a probability distribution for the group size being speciﬁed. The methodology and software allow for both discrete and continuous pricing. The class of possible models for price sensitivity functions is very wide, and includes piecewise linear models. A mechanism for constructing piecewise linear price sensitivity functions is provided. | |
