| Abstract | This document provides a brief introduction to the R package gss for nonparametric statistical modeling in a variety of problem settings including regression, density estimation, and hazard estimation. Functional ANOVA (analysis of variance) decompositions are built into models on product domains, and modeling and inferential tools are provided for tasks such as interval estimates, the “testing” of negligible model terms, the handling of correlated data, etc. The methodological background is outlined, and data analysis is illustrated using real-data examples.| |
