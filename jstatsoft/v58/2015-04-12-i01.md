| Abstract | The capabilities of the package exams for automatic generation of (statistical) exams in R are extended by adding support for learning management systems: As in earlier versions of the package exam generation is still based on separate Sweave ﬁles for each exercise – but rather than just producing diﬀerent types of PDF output ﬁles, the package can now render the same exercises into a wide variety of output formats. These include HTML (with various options for displaying mathematical content) and XML speciﬁcations for online exams in learning management systems such as Moodle or OLAT. This ﬂexibility is accomplished by a new modular and extensible design of the package that allows for reading all weaved exercises into R and managing associated supplementary ﬁles (such as graphics or data ﬁles). The manuscript discusses the readily available user interfaces, the design of the underlying infrastructure, and how new functionality can be built on top of the existing tools. | |
