| Abstract | The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the R  package conting  for the Bayesian analysis of complete and incomplete contingency tables using hierarchical log-linear models. This package allows a user to identify interactions between categorical factors (via complete contingency tables) and to estimate closed population sizes using capture-recapture studies (via incomplete contingency tables). The models are fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular, implementations of the Metropolis-Hastings and reversible jump algorithms appropriate for log-linear models are employed. The conting  package is demonstrated on four real examples.| |
