| Abstract | Fisher's exact test (FET) is an important statistical method for testing association between two groups. However, the computations involved in FET are extremely tedious and time consuming due to multi-step factorial calculations after the construction of numerous 2x2 tables depending on the smallest cell value. A Visual-Basic computer program, CalcFisher, has been developed to handle the complexities of FET resorting the techniques of looping subroutines and logarithmic conversions. The software automatically calculates the P-value after entering the respective cell values and has been validated for proper functioning with a wide range of frequencies (tens to several thousands). The important features of the program include, easy data entry, tail-selection, comprehensive report format and the facility of printing and saving of results.| |
