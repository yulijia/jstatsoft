| Abstract | MinPROMEP, written in SAS macros, is a program that generates partially replicated minimal orthogonal main-effect plans (minimal PROMEP's) for a given set of specified factor levels. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalization of the construction of Jacroux (1992, 1993). By using specific collapsing schemes, duplicated points are embedded in the design. In some cases, the generated minimal PROMEP has maximum number of duplicate points.| |
