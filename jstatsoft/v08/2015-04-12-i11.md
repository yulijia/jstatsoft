| Abstract | Scatterplot3d is an R package for the visualization of multivariate data in a three dimensional space. R is a "language for data analysis and graphics". | |
 In this paper we discuss the features of the package. It is designed by exclusively making use of already existing functions of R and its graphics system and thus shows the extensibility of the R graphics system. Additionally some examples on generated and real world data are provided.| |
