| Abstract | We illustrate how to fit multilevel models in the <b>MLwiN</b> package seamlessly from within Stata using the Stata program <code>runmlwin</code>. We argue that using <b>MLwiN</b> and Stata in combination allows researchers to capitalize on the best features of both packages. We provide examples of how to use <code>runmlwin</code> to fit continuous, binary, ordinal, nominal and mixed response multilevel models by both maximum likelihood and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation.| |
