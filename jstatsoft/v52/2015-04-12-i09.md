| Abstract | The basic purpose of the economic design of the control charts is to find the optimum control charts parameters to minimize the process cost. In this paper, an R package, <b>edcc</b> (economic design of control charts), which provides a numerical method to find the optimum chart parameters is presented using the unified approach of the economic design. Also, some examples are given to illustrate how to use this package. The types of the control chart available in the <b>edcc</b> package are X̅, CUSUM (cumulative sum), and EWMA (exponentially-weighted moving average) control charts.| |
