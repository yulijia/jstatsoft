| Abstract | This paper introduces an R package for spatial and spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting for log-Gaussian Cox processes. The main computational tool for these models is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the new package, <b>lgcp</b>, therefore also provides an extensible suite of functions for implementing MCMC algorithms for processes of this type. The modeling framework and details of inferential procedures are first presented before a tour of <b>lgcp</b> functionality is given via a walk-through data-analysis. Topics covered include reading in and converting data, estimation of the key components and parameters of the model, specifying output and simulation quantities, computation of Monte Carlo expectations, post-processing and simulation of data sets.| |
