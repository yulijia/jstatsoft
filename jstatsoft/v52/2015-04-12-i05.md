| Abstract | The <b>RcppEigen</b> package provides access from R (R Core Team 2012a) to the <b>Eigen</b> (Guennebaud, Jacob, and others 2012) C++ template library for numerical linear algebra. <b>Rcpp</b> (Eddelbuettel and François 2011, 2012) classes and specializations of the C++ templated functions <code>as</code> and <code>wrap</code> from <b>Rcpp</b> provide the "glue" for passing objects from R to C++ and back. Several introductory examples are presented. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of various available approaches for solving least-squares problems, including rank-revealing methods, concluding with an empirical run-time comparison. Last but not least, sparse matrix methods are discussed.| |
