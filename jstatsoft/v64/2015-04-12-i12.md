| Abstract |  Gaussian process (GP) models are commonly used statistical metamodels for emulating expensive computer simulators. Fitting a GP model can be numerically unstable if any pair of design points in the input space are close together. Ranjan, Haynes, and Karsten (2011) proposed a computationally stable approach for fitting GP models to deterministic computer simulators. They used a genetic algorithm based approach that is robust but computationally intensive for maximizing the likelihood. This paper implements a slightly modified version ofthe model proposed by Ranjan et al.  (2011 ) in the R  package GPfit. A novel parameterization of the spatial correlation function and a clustering based multi-start gradient based optimization algorithm yield robust optimization that is typically faster than the genetic algorithm based approach. We present two examples with R  codes to illustrate the usage of the main functions in GPfit . Several test functions are used for performance comparison with the popular R  package mlegp . We also use GPfit  for a real application, i.e., for emulating the tidal kinetic energy model for the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada.
