| Abstract | This paper presents the <b>R</b> package <b>anacor</b> for the computation of simple and canonical correspondence analysis with missing values. The canonical correspondence analysis is specified in a rather general way by imposing covariates on the rows and/or the columns of the two-dimensional frequency table. The package allows for scaling methods such as standard, Benzécri, centroid, and Goodman scaling. In addition, along with well-known two- and three-dimensional joint plots including confidence ellipsoids, it offers alternative plotting possibilities in terms of transformation plots, Benzécri plots, and regression plots.| |
