| Abstract | We present data structures and algorithms for sets and some generalizations thereof (fuzzy sets, multisets, and fuzzy multisets) available for <b>R</b> through the <b>sets</b> package. Fuzzy (multi-)sets are based on dynamically bound fuzzy logic families.  Further extensions include user-definable iterators and matching functions.| |
