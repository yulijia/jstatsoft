| Abstract | Diffusion weighted imaging has become and will certainly continue to be an important tool in medical research and diagnostics. Data obtained with diffusion weighted imaging are characterized by a high noise level. Thus, estimation  of quantities like anisotropy indices or the main diffusion direction may be significantly compromised by noise in clinical or neuroscience applications.| |
 Here, we present a new package <b>dti</b> for <b>R</b>, which provides functions for the analysis of diffusion weighted data within the diffusion tensor model.  This includes smoothing by a recently proposed structural adaptive smoothing procedure based on the propagation-separation approach in the context of the widely used diffusion tensor model. We extend the procedure and show, how a correction for Rician bias can be incorporated. We use a heteroscedastic nonlinear regression model to estimate the diffusion tensor. The smoothing procedure naturally adapts to different structures of different size and thus avoids oversmoothing edges and fine structures.| |
 We illustrate the usage and capabilities of the package through some examples.| |
