| Abstract | A computer program to estimate Poisson regression coefficients, standard errors, Pearson x<sup>2</sup> and deviance goodness of fit (and residuals), leverages, and Freeman-Tukey, standardized, and deletion residuals for additive, multiplicative, power, and non-linear models is described. Data used by the program must be stored and input from a disk file. The output file contains an optional list of the input data, observed and fitted count data (deaths or cases), coefficients, standard errors, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals, variance-covariance matrix, correlation matrix, goodness of fit statistics, and residuals for regression diagnostics.| |
