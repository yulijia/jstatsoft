| Abstract | The asypow library consists of routines written in the S language that calculate power and related quantities utilizing asymptotic methods. A paper describing these methods with examples is in preparation [1]. Two methods are available. The likelihood ratio method (LR) is described in [2]. Another general method appears recently in [3]; and we designate it the SMO method after the initials of the authors.
