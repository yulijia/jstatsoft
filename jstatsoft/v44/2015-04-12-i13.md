| Abstract | Functional integration in the brain refers to distributed interactions among functionally segregated regions. Investigation of effective connectivity in brain networks, i.e, the directed causal influence that one brain region exerts over another region, is being increasingly recognized as an important tool for understanding brain function in neuroimaging studies. Methods for identifying intrinsic relationships among elements in a network are increasingly in demand.
