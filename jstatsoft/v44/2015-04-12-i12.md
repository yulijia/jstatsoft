| Abstract | Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a magnetic resonance (MR) based method to investigate water diffusion in tissue like the human brain. Inference focuses on integral properties of the tissue microstructure. The acquired data are usually modeled using the diffusion tensor model, a three-dimensional Gaussian model for the diffusion process. Since the homogeneity assumption behind this model is not valid in large portion of the brain voxel more sophisticated approaches have been developed.
