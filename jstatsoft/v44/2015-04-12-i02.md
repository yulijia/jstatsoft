| Abstract | A common feature of many magnetic resonance image (MRI) data processing methods is the voxel-by-voxel (a voxel is a volume element) manner in which the processing is performed. In general, however, MRI data are expected to exhibit some level of spatial correlation, rendering an independent-voxels treatment inefficient in its use of the data. Bayesian random effect models are expected to be more efficient owing to their information-borrowing behaviour.
