| Abstract | In this article the MCPMod package for the R programming environment will be introduced. It implements a recently developed methodology for the design and analysis of dose-response studies that combines aspects of multiple comparison procedures and modeling approaches (Bretz et al. 2005). The MCPMod package provides tools for the analysis of dose finding trials, as well as a variety of tools necessary to plan an experiment to be analyzed using the MCP-Mod methodology.| |
