| Abstract | RinRuby is a Ruby library that integrates the R interpreter in Ruby, making R's statistical routines and graphics available within Ruby. The library consists of a single Ruby script that is simple to install and does not require any special compilation or installation of R.  Since the library is 100% pure Ruby, it works on a variety of operating systems, Ruby implementations, and versions of R.  RinRuby's methods are simple, making for readable code.  This paper describes RinRuby usage, provides comprehensive documentation, gives several examples, and discusses RinRuby's implementation.  The latest version of RinRuby can be found at the project website: http://rinruby.ddahl.org/.| |
