| Abstract | We discuss <code>R</code> package <b>BB</b>, in particular, its capabilities for solving a nonlinear system of equations.  The function <code>BBsolve</code> in <b>BB</b> can be used for this purpose. We demonstrate the utility of these functions for solving: (a) large systems of nonlinear equations, (b) smooth, nonlinear estimating equations in statistical modeling, and
