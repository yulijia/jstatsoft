| Abstract | Classical categorical regression models such as the multinomial logit and proportional odds models are shown to be readily handled by the  vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) framework. Additionally, there are natural extensions, such as reduced-rank VGLMs for dimension reduction, and allowing covariates that have values specific to each linear/additive predictor, e.g., for consumer choice modeling. This article describes some of the framework behind the <b>VGAM</b> R package, its usage and implementation details.| |
