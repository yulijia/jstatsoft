| Abstract | Based on recent work by Fox and Andersen (2006), this paper describes substantial extensions to the <b>effects</b> package for <b>R</b> to construct effect displays for multinomial and proportional-odds logit models.  The package previously was limited to linear and generalized linear models.  Effect displays are tabular and graphical representations of terms &mdash; typically high-order terms &mdash; in a statistical model.  For polytomous logit models, effect displays depict fitted category probabilities under the model, and can include point-wise confidence envelopes for the effects.  The construction of effect displays by functions in the <b>effects</b> package is essentially automatic. The package provides several kinds of displays for polytomous logit models.| |
