| Abstract |  During the last decade text mining has become a widely used   discipline utilizing statistical and machine learning methods. We  present the <strong>tm</strong> package which provides a framework for text mining  applications within R. We give a survey on text mining facilities in R and explain how typical application tasks can be carried out using our framework. We present techniques for count-based analysis methods, text clustering, text classification and string kernels.| |
