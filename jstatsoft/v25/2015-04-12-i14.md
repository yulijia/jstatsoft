| Abstract | The GEEQBOX toolbox analyzes correlated data via the method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) and quasi-least squares (QLS), an approach based on GEE that overcomes some limitations of GEE that have been noted in the literature. GEEQBOX is currently able to handle correlated data that follows a normal, Bernoulli or Poisson distribution, and that is assumed to have an AR(1), Markov, tri-diagonal, equicorrelated, unstructured or working independence correlation structure. This toolbox is for use with MATLAB.| |
