| Abstract | Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a popular technology to search for an optimum in a large search space. Using new concepts of forbidden array and weighted mutation, Mandal, Wu, and Johnson (2006) used elements of GAs to introduce a new global optimization technique called sequential elimination of level combinations (SELC), that efficiently finds optimums.  A SAS macro, and MATLAB and R functions are developed to implement the SELC algorithm.| |
