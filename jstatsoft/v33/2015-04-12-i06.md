| Abstract | This document describes the new features in version 2.x of the <b>tgp</b> package for R, implementing treed Gaussian process (GP) models. The topics covered include methods for dealing with categorical inputs and excluding inputs from the tree or GP part of the model; fully Bayesian sensitivity analysis for inputs/covariates; sequential optimization of black-box functions; and a new Monte Carlo method for inference in multi-modal posterior distributions that combines simulated tempering and importance sampling. These additions extend the functionality of <b>tgp</b> across all models in the hierarchy: from Bayesian linear models, to classification and regression trees (CART), to treed Gaussian processes with jumps to the limiting linear model. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the baseline functionality of the package, outlined in the first vignette (Gramacy 2007).| |
