| Abstract | In standardized testing it is important to equate tests in order to ensure that the test takers, regardless of the test version given, obtain a fair test. Recently, the kernel method of test equating, which is a conjoint framework of test equating, has gained popularity. The kernel method of test equating includes five steps: (1) pre-smoothing, (2) estimation of the score probabilities, (3) continuization, (4) equating, and (5) computing the standard error of equating and the standard error of equating difference. Here, an implementation has been made for six different equating designs: equivalent groups, single group, counter balanced, non-equivalent groups with anchor test using either chain equating or post- stratification equating, and non-equivalent groups using covariates. An R package for the kernel method of test equating called kequate is presented. Included in the package are also diagnostic tools aiding in the search for a proper log-linear model in the pre-smoothing step for use in conjunction with the R function glm.| |
