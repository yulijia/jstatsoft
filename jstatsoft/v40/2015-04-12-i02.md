| Abstract | This paper describes an R package which produces tours of multivariate data. The package includes functions for creating different types of tours, including grand, guided, and little tours, which project multivariate data (p-D) down to 1, 2, 3, or, more generally, d (≤ p) dimensions. The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to <b>GGobi</b>, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with different, and new, approaches to tours of data. This paper contains animations that can be viewed using the Adobe Acrobat PDF viewer.| |
