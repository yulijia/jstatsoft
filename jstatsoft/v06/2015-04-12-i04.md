| Abstract | CoCo is a program for estimation, test and model search among hierarchical interaction models for large complete contingency tables. The name CoCo is derivated of "Co"mplete "Co"ntingency tables, since the initial program could only handle complete tables, but the program has been enhanced to handle incomplete tables.| |
 CoCo works especially efficiently on graphical models, and some of the commands are designed to handle graphical models.| |
