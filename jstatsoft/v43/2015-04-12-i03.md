| Abstract | Locally stationary process representations have recently been proposed and applied to both time series and image analysis applications. This article describes an implementation of the locally stationary two-dimensional wavelet process approach in R. This package permits construction of estimates of spatially localized spectra and localized autocovariance which can be used to characterize structure within images.| |
