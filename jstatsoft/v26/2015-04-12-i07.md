| Abstract | We present the <b>cacher</b> package for <b>R</b>, which provides tools for caching statistical analyses and for distributing these analyses to others in an efficient manner.  The <b>cacher</b> package takes objects created by evaluating <b>R</b> expressions and stores them in key-value databases.  These databases of cached objects can subsequently be assembled into packages for distribution over the web.  The <b>cacher</b> package also provides tools to help readers examine the data and code in a statistical analysis and reproduce, modify, or improve upon the results.  In addition, readers can easily conduct alternate analyses of the data.  We describe the design and implementation of the <b>cacher</b> package and provide two examples of how the package can be used for reproducible research.| |
