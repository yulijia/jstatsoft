| Abstract | This article describes the benchden package which implements a set of 28 example densities for nonparametric density estimation in R. In addition to the usual functions that evaluate the density, distribution and quantile functions or generate random variates, a function designed to be specifically useful for larger simulation studies has been added. After describing the set of densities and the usage of the package, a small toy example of a simulation study conducted using the benchden package is given.| |
