| Abstract | We present the R package bild for the parametric and graphical analysis of binary longitudinal data. The package performs logistic regression for binary longitudinal data, allowing for serial dependence among observations from a given individual and a random intercept term. Estimation is via maximization of the exact likelihood of a suitably defined model. Missing values and unbalanced data are allowed, with some restrictions. The code of bild is written partly in R language, partly in Fortran 77, interfaced through R. The package is built following the S4 formulation of R methods.| |
