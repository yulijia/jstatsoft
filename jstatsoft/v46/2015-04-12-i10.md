| Abstract | In this paper we present the R package gRain for propagation in graphical independence networks (for which Bayesian networks is a special instance). The paper includes a description of the theory behind the computations. The main part of the paper is an illustration of how to use the package. The paper also illustrates how to turn a graphical model and data into an independence network.| |
