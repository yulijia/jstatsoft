| Abstract | This paper describes a set of Lisp-Stat tools for building Generalised Estimating Equation models to analyse longitudinal or clustered measurements. The user interface is based on the built-in regression and generalised linear model prototypes, with the addition of object-based error functions, correlation structures and model formula tools. Residual and deletion diagnostic plots are available on the cluster and observation level and use the dynamic graphics capabilities of Lisp-Stat.| |
