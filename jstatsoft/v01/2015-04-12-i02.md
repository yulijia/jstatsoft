| Abstract | In this paper a highly interactive, user-friendly Lisp program is introduced to perform homogeneity analysis. A brief introduction to the technique is presented as well as its modification in the presence of missing data. The algorithm and its Lisp implemenation is discussed, and an overview of the object oriented code that produces the interactive dialogs and plots is provided. In order to demonstrate the main features of the program, a small and a large dataset are analyzed. Finally, some comparisons are made with other currently available programs.| |
