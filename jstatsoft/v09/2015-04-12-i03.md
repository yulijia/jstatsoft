| Abstract | The purpose of this brief note is to bring to the attention of readers a collection of Fortran routines which may be useful to readers of this journal.  The author collected the routines over many years, starting while acting as a statistical consultant in CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia). Though most statistical analysis is now done using statistical packages, code in Fortran and other languages is useful for instance when developing new tests or estimates, or for finding maximum likelihood estimates in complex cases.| |
