| Abstract | This document contains program code and examples of survival analyses in XLISP-Stat, structured using the <code>noweb</code> (Ramsey, 1993) literate programming system. It is described as a "semiliterate" program because most of the code was already written before it was converted to use <code>noweb</code>.
