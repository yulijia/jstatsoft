| Abstract | Trimmed regions are a powerful tool of multivariate data analysis. They describe a probability distribution in Euclidean d-space regarding location, dispersion, and shape, and they order multivariate data with respect to their centrality. Dyckerhoff and Mosler (2011) have introduced the class of weighted-mean trimmed regions, which possess attrac- tive properties regarding continuity, subadditivity, and monotonicity.
