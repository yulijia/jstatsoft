| Abstract | For right-censored data perhaps the most commonly used tests are weighted logrank tests, such as the logrank and Wilcoxon-type tests. In this paper we review several generalizations of those weighted logrank tests to interval-censored data and present an <b>R</b> package, <b>interval</b>, to implement many of them.  The <b>interval</b> package depends on the <b>perm</b> package, also presented here, which performs exact and asymptotic linear permutation tests.  The <b>perm</b> package performs many of the tests included in the already available <b>coin</b> package, and provides an independent validation of <b>coin</b>.  We review analysis methods for interval-censored data, and we describe and show how to use the <b>interval</b> and <b>perm</b> packages.| |
