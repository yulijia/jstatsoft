| Abstract | Cluster ensembles have emerged as a powerful meta-learning paradigm that provides improved accuracy and robustness by aggregating several input data clusterings. In particular, link-based similarity methods have recently been introduced with superior performance to the conventional co-association approach.  This paper presents a <b>MATLAB</b> package, <b>LinkCluE</b>, that implements the link-based cluster ensemble framework. A variety of functional methods for evaluating clustering results, based on both internal and external criteria, are also provided.  Additionally, the underlying algorithms together with the sample uses of the package with interesting real and synthetic datasets are demonstrated herein.| |
