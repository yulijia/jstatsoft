| Abstract | The <b>tolerance</b> package for <b>R</b> provides a set of functions for estimating and plotting tolerance limits.  This package provides a wide-range of functions for estimating discrete and continuous tolerance intervals as well as for estimating regression tolerance intervals.  An additional tool of the <b>tolerance</b> package is the plotting capability for the univariate and regression settings as well as for the multivariate normal setting.  The <b>tolerance</b> package's capabilities are illustrated using simulated data sets.  Formulas used for the estimation procedures are also presented.| |
