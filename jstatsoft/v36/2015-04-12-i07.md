| Abstract | <b>depmixS4</b> implements a general framework for defining and estimating dependent mixture models in the <b>R</b> programming language.  This includes standard Markov models, latent/hidden Markov models, and latent class and finite mixture distribution models.  The models can be fitted on mixed multivariate data with distributions from the <b>glm</b> family, the (logistic) multinomial, or the multivariate normal distribution.  Other distributions can be added easily, and an example is provided with the <i>exgaus</i> distribution.  Parameters are estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or, when (linear) constraints are imposed on the parameters, by direct numerical optimization with the <b>Rsolnp</b> or <b>Rdonlp2</b> routines.| |
