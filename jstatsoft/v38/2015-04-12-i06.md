| Abstract | The Lexis class in the R package <b>Epi</b> provides tools for creation, manipulation and display of data from multi-state models. Transitions between states are described by rates (intensities); Lexis objects represent this kind of data and provide tools to show states and transitions annotated by relevant summary numbers. Data can be transformed to a form that allows modelling of several transition rates with common parameters.| |
