| Abstract | The Lexis class in the R package <b>Epi</b> provides an object-based framework for managing follow-up time on multiple time scales, which is an important feature of prospective epidemiological studies with long duration. Follow-up time may be split either into fixed time bands, or on individual event times and the split data may be used in Poisson regression models that account for the evolution of disease risk on multiple time scales. The summary and plot methods for Lexis objects allow inspection of the follow-up times.| |
