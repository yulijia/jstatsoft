| Abstract | There is a clear growing interest, at least in the statistical literature, in competing risks and multi-state models. With the rising interest in competing risks and multi-state models a number of software packages have been developed for the analysis of such models. The present special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software introduces a selection of R packages devoted to competing risks and multi-state models. This introduction to the special issue contains some background and highlights the contents of the contributions.| |
