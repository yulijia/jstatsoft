| Abstract | The package can be used to analyze the performance of step-up and step-down procedures. It can be used to compare powers, calculate the “false discovery rate”, to study the effects of reduced step procedures, and to calculate P [U ≤ k], where U is the number of rejected true hypotheses. It can be used to determine the maximum number of steps that can be made and still guarantee (with a given probability) that the number of false rejections will not exceed some specified number. The test statistics are assumed to have a multivariate-t distribution. Examples are included.| |
