| Abstract | This paper describes a graphical user interface (GUI) for the <b>tourr</b> package in R. The tour is a dynamic graphical method for viewing multivariate data. The GUI allows users to interact with a tour in order to explore the data for structures like clustering, outliers, nonlinear dependence. Users can pause the tour, choose a subset of variables, color points by other variables, and switch between several different types of tours.| |
