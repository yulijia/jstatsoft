| Abstract | For many ecological analyses powerful statistical tools are required for a profound analysis of spatial and time based data sets. In order to avoid many common errors of analysis and data acquisition a graphical user interface can help to focus on the task of the analysis and minimize the time to fulfill certain tasks in a programming language like R. In this paper we present a graphical user interface for R embedded in the ecological modeling software <b>Bio7</b> which is based on an Eclipse rich client platform. We demonstrate that within the <b>Bio7</b> platform R can not only be effectively combined with Java but also with the powerful components of Eclipse. Additionally we present some custom <b>Bio7</b> components which interact with R and make use of some useful advanced concepts and libraries of this connection. Our overview on the <b>Bio7</b> R interface also emphasizes a broad applicability for disciplines beyond ecological modeling.| |
