| Abstract | The R Commander graphical user interface to R is extensible via plug-in packages, which integrate seamlessly with the R Commander's menu structure, data, and model handling. The paper describes the <b>RcmdrPlugin.survival</b> package, which makes many of the facilities of the <b>survival</b> package for R available through the R Commander, including Cox and parametric survival models. We explain the structure, capabilities, and limitations of this plug-in package and illustrate its use.| |
