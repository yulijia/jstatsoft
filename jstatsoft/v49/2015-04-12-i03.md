| Abstract | In this work the software application called <b>Glotaran</b> is introduced as a Java-based graphical user interface to the R package <b>TIMP</b>, a problem solving environment for fitting superposition models to multi-dimensional data. <b>TIMP</b> uses a command-line user interface for the interaction with data, the specification of models and viewing of analysis results. Instead, <b>Glotaran</b> provides a graphical user interface which features interactive and dynamic data inspection, easier -- assisted by the user interface -- model specification and interactive viewing of results. The interactivity component is especially helpful when working with large, multi-dimensional datasets as often result from time-resolved spectroscopy measurements, allowing the user to easily pre-select and manipulate data before analysis and to quickly zoom in to regions of interest in the analysis results. <b>Glotaran</b> has been developed on top of the <b>NetBeans</b> rich client platform and communicates with R through the Java-to-R interface <b>Rserve</b>. The background and the functionality of the application are described here. In addition, the design, development and implementation process of <b>Glotaran</b> is documented in a generic way.| |
