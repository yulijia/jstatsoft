| Abstract | This special volume features eleven contributions to psychometric computing, a research area that integrates psychometrics and computational methods in statistics. Topics covered include structural equation modeling, item response theory, probabilistic choice modeling, and other modeling approaches prevalent in or useful for psychometric research. Each contributed paper is accompanied by a software package published on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This introduction gives a brief overview of the volume.| |
