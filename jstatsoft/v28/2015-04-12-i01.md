| Abstract | This paper presents R utilities for computing and displaying isosurfaces, or three-dimensional contour surfaces, from a three-dimensional array of function values.  A version of the marching cubes algorithm that takes into account face and internal ambiguities is used to compute the isosurfaces. Vectorization is used to ensure adequate performance using only R code.  Examples are presented showing contours of theoretical densities, density estimates, and medical imaging data.  Rendering can use the rgl package or standard or grid graphics, and a set of tools for representing and rendering surfaces using standard or grid graphics is presented.| |
