| Abstract | The X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment program of the US Census Bureau extracts the different components (mainly: seasonal component, trend component, outlier component and irregular component) of a monthly or quarterly time series. It is the state-of-the- art technology for seasonal adjustment used in many statistical offices. It is possible to include a moving holiday effect, a trading day effect and user-defined regressors, and additionally incorporates automatic outlier detection. The procedure makes additive or multiplicative adjustments and creates an output data set containing the adjusted time series and intermediate calculations.
