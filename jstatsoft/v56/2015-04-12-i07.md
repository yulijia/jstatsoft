| Abstract | The lmdme package decomposes analysis of variance (ANOVA) through linear mod- els on designed multivariate experiments, allowing ANOVA-principal component analysis (APCA) and ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) in R. It also extends both methods with the application of partial least squares (PLS) through the specification of a desired output matrix. The package is freely available from Bioconductor and licensed under the GNU General Public License.
