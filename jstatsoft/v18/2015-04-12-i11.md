| Abstract | We describe here an online software suite VOStat written mainly for the Virtual Observatory, a novel structure in which astronomers share terabyte scale data. Written mostly in the public-domain statistical computing language and environment R, it can do a variety of statistical analysis on multidimensional, multi-epoch data with errors.  Included are techniques which allow astronomers to start with multi-color data in the form of low-resolution spectra and select special kinds of sources in a variety of ways including color outliers. Here we describe the tool and demonstrate it with an example from Palomar-QUEST, a synoptic sky survey.| |
