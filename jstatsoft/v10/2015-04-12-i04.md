| Abstract | Generalized linear models (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) are a popular technique for modeling a large variety of continuous and discrete data. They assume that the response variables Y<sub>i</sub> , for i = 1, . . . , n, come from a distribution belonging to the exponential family, such that E[Y<sub>i</sub> ] = μ<sub>i</sub> and V[Y<sub>i</sub> ] = V (μ<sub>i</sub> ), and that η<sub>i</sub> = g(μ<sub>i</sub> ) = x<sub>i</sub><sup>T</sup>β², where β ∈ IR <sup>p</sup> is the vector of parameters, x<sub>i</sub> ∈ IR <sup>p</sup>, and g(.) is the link function. The non-robustness of the maximum likelihood and the maximum quasi-likelihood estimators has been studied extensively in the literature. For model selection, the classical analysis-of-deviance approach shares the same bad robustness properties. To cope with this, Cantoni and Ronchetti (2001) propose a robust approach based on robust quasi-deviance functions for estimation and variable selection. We refer to that paper for a deeper discussion and the review of the literature. | |
