| Abstract | This manual details the implementation of the profile matching techniques introduced in Robust Estimation of Air-Borne Particulate Matter (Wiens, Florence and Hiltz, Environmetrics, 2001 - included as an appendix). The program consists of a collection of functions written in S. It runs in S-Plus, including the student version. A graphical user interface is supplied for easy implementation by a user with only a passing familiarity with S-Plus. A description of the software is given, together with an extensive example of an analysis of a data set using the software. | |
 The software is available at | |

 where it is linked to the listing for Wiens, Florence and Hiltz (2001). | |
