| 摘要 | <b>IndElec</b> is a software addressed to compute a wide range of indices from electoral data, which are intended to analyze both party systems and electoral systems in political studies. Further, <b>IndElec</b> can calculate such indices from electoral data at several levels of aggregation, even when the acronyms of some political parties change across districts. As the amount of information provided by <b>IndElec</b> may be considerable, this software also aids the user in the analysis of electoral data through three capabilities. First, <b>IndElec</b> automatically elaborates preliminary descriptive statistical reports of computed indices. Second, <b>IndElec</b> saves the computed information into text files in data matrix format, which can be directly loaded by any statistical software to facilitate more sophisticated statistical studies. Third, <b>IndElec</b> provides results in several file formats (text, CSV, HTML, R) to facilitate their visualization and management by using a wide range of application softwares (word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers, etc.). Finally, a graphical user interface is provided for <b>IndElec</b> to manage calculation processes, but no visualization facility is available in this environment. In fact, both the inputs and outputs for <b>IndElec</b> are arranged in files with the aforementioned formats.| |
