| 摘要 | We describe an implementation of simple, multiple and joint correspondence analysis in R. The resulting package comprises two parts, one for simple correspondence analysis and one for multiple and joint correspondence analysis. Within each part, functions for computation, summaries and visualization in two and three dimensions are provided, including options to display supplementary points and perform subset analyses. Special emphasis has been put on the visualization functions that offer features such as different scaling options for biplots and three-dimensional maps using the rgl package. Graphical options include shading and sizing plot symbols for the points according to their contributions to the map and masses respectively.| |
