| 摘要 | This paper will describe my experiences in moving on from Lisp-Stat to Java to R.  I was introduced to Lisp-Stat in 1989 and used it actively for teaching and research over the next 10 years.  My use of Lisp-Stat culminated in a joint project with Hani Doss on Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis and it remains the largest piece of software I wrote using Lisp-Stat.  At the time the project was completed, the only open statistical system that could deliver the goods was Lisp-Stat.  In this article, I will describe how the power of Lisp, underlying statistical components and dynamic graphics were exploited in the project.  When development on Lisp-Stat slowed down, Java was coming into its own as an important language and R became an open source collaborative project.  Of course, I have moved on and I use R for most of my work today. I will touch upon my experience with Java and R briefly.| |
