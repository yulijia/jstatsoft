| 摘要 | The World Wide Web (WWW) is a new mechanism for providing information. At this point, the majority of the information on the WWW is static, which means it is incapable of responding to user input. Text, images, and video are examples of static information that can easily be included in a WWW page. With the advent of the Java programming language, it is now possible to embed dynamic information in the form of interactive programs called applets. Therefore, it is not only possible to transfer raw data over the WWW, but we can also now provide interactive graphics for displaying and exploring data in the context of a WWW page. In this paper, we will describe the use of Java applets that have been developed for the interactive display of high dimensional data on the WWW.| |
