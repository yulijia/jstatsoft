| 摘要 | Invariant coordinate selection (ICS) has recently been introduced as a method for exploring multivariate data. It includes as a special case a method for recovering the unmixing matrix in independent components analysis (ICA). It also serves as a basis for classes of multivariate nonparametric tests, and as a tool in cluster analysis  or blind discrimination. The aim of this paper is to briefly explain the (ICS) method and to illustrate how various applications can be implemented using the R package ICS. Several examples are used to show how the ICS method and ICS package can be used in analyzing a multivariate data set.| |
