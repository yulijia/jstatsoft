| 摘要 | StatCrunch, formerly known as WebStat, is a statistical data analysis software package for the World Wide Web (WWW). After version 1.0 [1] of the software was published as a prototype package in 1997, version 2.0 was released in 1999 as a fully functional statistical software package. 版本 2.0 offered an easy-to-use interface and basic statistical routines which were well suited for educational and low level research needs. The main aim of the menu driven package was to offer a freely accessible alternative to commercial statistical software via the WWW with the only minimal requirement on the part of the user being a Java capable Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.| |
